/*
âœ… Assignment:
Create a job channel (chan int)

Create a result channel (chan int)

Launch 3 goroutines as workers:

# Each should take a number from the job channel

# Square the number

# Send it to the result channel

# In main, send 10 numbers to the job channel

# Close the job channel once sending is done

# Use a WaitGroup to wait for workers to finish

Range over the result channel and print the results
