/*
ðŸ“‹ Assignment Details:
Create:

jobChan â†’ sends numbers 1 to 30

resultChan â†’ receives results like: Number: 17 is Prime or Number: 18 is NOT Prime

# Fixed number of 3 workers

Each worker:

# Picks a number from jobChan

Checks if itâ€™s prime (write a small isPrime(n int) function)

# Sends the message string to resultChan

Use:

sync.WaitGroup to wait until all workers finish

# Close resultChan after all work is done

Print results in main by ranging over resultChan
