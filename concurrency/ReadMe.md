## 📘 Understanding Channels in Go (with Examples)

This README demonstrates how **Go channels** behave under different conditions, highlighting:

* Unbuffered vs buffered channels
* Blocking behavior and deadlocks
* Synchronization with `sync.WaitGroup`
* Proper channel usage (e.g., who should close it)

---

## 🧪 Unbuffered Channel Basics

### ❌ Deadlock Example 1 — No Receiver

```go
myChan := make(chan int)
myChan <- 76 // ❌ Deadlock: no receiver
```

> **Explanation**: Unbuffered channels block until both sender and receiver are ready. Since no goroutine is reading from the channel, the send blocks forever.

---

### ❌ Deadlock Example 2 — Receiver Too Late

```go
myChan := make(chan int)
myChan <- 76 // ❌ Still blocks

go func() {
    fmt.Println(<-myChan)
}()
```

> **Explanation**: Even though a receiver exists, it is created *after* the blocking send. The program deadlocks because the sender never completes, and the receiver is never scheduled.

---

### ✅ Working Example — Receiver First

```go
myChan := make(chan int)

go func() {
    fmt.Println(<-myChan)
}()

myChan <- 76 // ✅ This works!
```

> **Explanation**: The receiver is already listening when the send occurs, so the send proceeds and the value is received.

---

## 💾 Buffered Channels

### ✅ Buffered Send and Receive

```go
bufferChan := make(chan int, 1)
bufferChan <- 76         // ✅ Does not block: space in buffer
fmt.Println(<-bufferChan) // ✅ Outputs: 76
```

---

### ❌ Buffer Overflow (Deadlock)

```go
bufferChan := make(chan int, 1)
bufferChan <- 76         // OK
bufferChan <- 77         // ❌ Deadlock: buffer is full
```

> **Fix**: To avoid this, read from the buffer before trying to send another value.

---

## 🔁 Range Over a Channel

### ❌ Receiver Blocking on Closed Channel

```go
bufferChan := make(chan int, 1)
bufferChan <- 76

for val := range bufferChan {
    fmt.Println(val)
}
// ❌ Deadlock: the loop never exits unless channel is closed
```

> **Fix**: You must close the channel for `range` to finish.

---

## ✅ Concurrent Example With `sync.WaitGroup`

Here’s a fixed and working version of your full example:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    bufferChan := make(chan int, 1)
    wg := sync.WaitGroup{}
    wg.Add(2) // We'll wait for both sender and receiver

    // Sender goroutine
    go func() {
        senderWg := sync.WaitGroup{}
        for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
            senderWg.Add(1)
            go func(val int) {
                defer senderWg.Done()
                time.Sleep(10 * time.Millisecond)
                bufferChan <- val
            }(i)
        }
        senderWg.Wait()
        close(bufferChan) // ✅ Only sender should close
        wg.Done()
    }()

    // Receiver goroutine
    go func() {
        for val := range bufferChan {
            fmt.Println(val)
        }
        wg.Done()
    }()

    wg.Wait()
}
```

## ✅ Key Concepts Recap

| Concept             | Explanation                                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unbuffered channels | Block until both sender and receiver are ready.                       |
| Buffered channels   | Allow sending without blocking — up to capacity.                      |
| `range` on channels | Only exits when the channel is **closed**.                            |
| Closing a channel   | Only the **sender** should close a channel.                           |
| `sync.WaitGroup`    | Used to coordinate goroutines and avoid exiting early or deadlocking. |

## ❗ Common Misconceptions (Fixed)

| Misconception                             | Correction                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Receiver can close the channel”          | ❌ **Only the sender** should close the channel.                                   |
| “Buffered channel won’t block”            | ❌ It still blocks **once full**.                                                  |
| “Send and receive in same function works” | ❌ Not without a goroutine — both will block.                                      |
| `for i := range 100` is valid             | ❌ Use `for i := 0; i < 100; i++` instead.                                         |
| Channels work like slices                 | ❌ Channels are synchronous (unless buffered), and behave differently from slices. |

## 🧠 Final Tips for Interviews

* Always mention that **unbuffered channels are blocking**.
* Use `go func() {}` to run either the sender or receiver concurrently.
* Don’t forget to **close channels** when you're done — especially when ranging.
* Explain **why only the sender should close** the channel.
* Use `sync.WaitGroup` to safely wait for goroutines to finish.

📌 When to use RWMutex?
Use it when:

You have frequent reads and rare writes

You want to allow multiple reads in parallel, but writes should be exclusive
| Lock Type | Purpose                        | Allows             | Blocks              |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| `RLock()` | Read-only access (multiple OK) | ✅ Multiple readers | ❌ Writers           |
| `Lock()`  | Write access (exclusive)       | ❌ Only one writer  | ❌ Readers & Writers |

## 🟢 Goroutine Leaks

**What it is**
A goroutine leak happens when you spawn a goroutine that never exits because its work channel or cancellation condition never arrives. Over time, leaked goroutines consume memory and CPU.

**Example of a leak**

```go
func worker(jobs <-chan int) {
  for j := range jobs { // if `jobs` is never closed, this never returns
    _ = j * j
  }
}
```

**Prevention**

* Always close your work channels when done.
* Or, use a `context.Context` and inside your loop:

  ```go
  select {
  case <-ctx.Done(): return
  case j := <-jobs: …
  }
  ```

**Interview Q**

> How do you detect and prevent goroutine leaks in Go?

---

## 🟢 Real-World Patterns

### 1. Job Queue + Worker Pool

* Jobs are sent into a channel.
* A fixed set of goroutines (“workers”) range over it and process items.
* Close the channel when no more jobs; workers exit.

### 2. Observability

* Track metrics (counters, histograms) inside your workers with `expvar` or Prometheus.
* E.g., increment a global counter each time a job completes.

### 3. Graceful Shutdown

* On `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`, stop accepting new work, signal workers (via `context`), wait for them to finish, then exit.
* In HTTP servers: call `server.Shutdown(ctx)` so in-flight requests complete.

**Interview Q**

> Describe how you’d implement a graceful shutdown of a worker pool on Ctrl+C.

---

## 🟢 Benchmarking (`go test -bench`)

**What it is**
Measure how fast a piece of code runs—useful to compare approaches (e.g., mutex vs. channel).

**Basic benchmark**

```go
func BenchmarkMutex(b *testing.B) {
  var mu sync.Mutex
  cnt := 0
  for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
    mu.Lock()
    cnt++
    mu.Unlock()
  }
}
```

Run with:

```bash
go test -bench=.  
```

**Interview Q**

> How would you benchmark and compare two different concurrency approaches in Go?

---

## 🟢 `sync.Mutex` vs `sync.RWMutex`

* **`sync.Mutex`**: only one goroutine at a time (both readers and writers block).
* **`sync.RWMutex`**: multiple readers allowed in parallel (`RLock`), but writers (`Lock`) are exclusive.

**RWMutex Example**

```go
var mu sync.RWMutex
var data map[string]int

// reader
mu.RLock()
_ = data["key"]
mu.RUnlock()

// writer
mu.Lock()
data["key"] = 42
mu.Unlock()
```

**Interview Q**

> When would you choose an `RWMutex` over a plain `Mutex`?

---

## 🟢 Channel vs Mutex (When to Use Which)

* **Channels**: great for passing ownership of data and building pipelines/fan-in-out.
* **Mutexes**: simpler for protecting small shared data (counters, maps).

**Guideline**

* Use channels to coordinate **work** between goroutines.
* Use a mutex when multiple goroutines need **shared access** to a variable.

**Interview Q**

> Can you give an example where a mutex is more appropriate than a channel, and vice versa?
